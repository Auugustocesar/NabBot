# Rewrite branch
This branch uses the `rewrite` branch of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite), which is still
under development and include breaking changes, so this branch is not recommended for general use.  
**Use this at own risk. It's recommended to read commit changes before pulling.**
