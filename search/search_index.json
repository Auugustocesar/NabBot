This can be done using the command settings world . For the moment, only one world can be configured per server. How do I invite NabBot to my server? \u00b6 For an always up to date invite link, go to Discord Bots and click Invite . Also, if you like NabBot, don't forget to vote for us! __________ doesn't look well or doesn't work on mobile \u00b6 The Android and iOS versions of Discord are really behind the web or standalone client, so NabBot is focused on desktop users. If we limit ourselves to the mobile versions we would be slowing down the development of NabBot. Self Hosting \u00b6 Note In order to run and manage NabBot, basic knowledge of Python is expected. I can't run NabBot, python is not found. \u00b6 If you get an error like this: \u201cpython\u201d is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. , it can be due to one of these reasons: Python is not installed. To install visit Python.org The python folder is not in the PATH enviroment variable. This is prompted when installing Python. My world is getting merged, what do I do? \u00b6 NabBot can't detect world merges, so you have to run the /merge command to change all content of the old world to the new one: Someone got a namechange, what now? \u00b6 Name changes are automatically updated by NabBot, so nothing needs to be done here, the character will be updated automatically the first time he is checked. Namelocks are more complicated. What do I do with namelocked characters? \u00b6 Because of the way namelocks work, all references lost to the old name are completely gone on tibia.com, so it's nearly impossible to detect this change, resulting in people just registering their new character and ending with duplicates. To fix this, a server administrator can use the namelock command: /namelock Oldname,Newname If new name was already registered again, this will merge both character entries into one. Otherwise, it will just rename Oldname to new name. Since there's no way to check this, this should be done with care. The only thing that NabBot can verify is that their vocations match. /merge Fidera Gladera This will tell the bot that Fidera has merged into Gladera , changing all references of Fidera to Gladera. Note that this change be irreversible, so this must be used under your own risk. It's recommended to do this right after the server save that will merge the worlds. Miscellaneous \u00b6 Can you help me or make a cavebot/macro? \u00b6 No. How can I make NabBot work for this OT server? \u00b6 NabBot was made to work specifically for Tibia, it depends completely on the layout of Tibia.com so even if the URLs were changed to an OT's website, the code used to parse information would have to be changed.

When installing on Windows, make sure that you select the option to add Python to PATH . Once installed, you need to find what's the python's executable name, depending on the installation, it can be either python , python3 or py . Once the correct command has been found, open a terminal window on NabBot's root directory and run the following: python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt Creating an Application \u00b6 In order to run a Discord bot, you need to create a new application. Go to My Apps in the developers portal. Once you're here, click on the New App button. Fill the fields, Click on Create App once you're done. Now that you have created your App, look for the Create a Bot User button. You're going to need two things from here, your Client ID , found at the top, and your Token , found in the Bot section. Your Client ID should look like 391624006744145920 and your token like MzkxNjI0MDA2NzQ0MTQ1OTIw.DRbYSQ.EbWIRWMqEQCYSBhlnNpG7FQLwZs Warning Your token is secret, never expose it to anyone. Anyone with access to your token can run a bot as you, compromising your account if they break discord's Terms of Service Running your bot \u00b6 The first time you run nabbot.py , you will be asked for a token. Here's where you will use the token given on the App page. Once you entered the token, the bot will log in. You should see a dialog showing that the bot is now online. Inviting your bot \u00b6 To invite your bot to your server, you need to use the authentication URL. Here's where your Client ID is used. https : // discordapp . com / oauth2 / authorize?scope = bot & permissions = 268954832 & client_id = CLIENT_ID_HERE Info Make sure you don't deny any of the permissions requested as they are necessary for NabBot.

Depending on your privacy settings, you (or the owner of the server) should have received a DM by NabBot explaining how to do the inital configuration. Initial configuration \u00b6 In order for the bot to have access to most of its features, you must configure the world the server tracks. Use the command settings world , for example: /settings world Gladera . Then the bot will ask for confirmation. Once accepted, users can start registering their chars using \\im charName . By default, events, level ups and deaths announcements are made on the highest channel available for the bot. In order to customize this, you can use the following commands: /settings levelschannel . The bot usually shortens command replies on public channels to reduce spam a bit. Commands used via DM display more information. Alternatively, you can create a channel named #ask-nabbot . The bot will give longer responses here and it will delete any message that is not a command, leaving this as a channel dedicated to commands. Additionally, you can create a channel named #server-log . Whenever a user registers characters, they will be shown here, along with their levels and guilds.

To operate correctly, the bot needs the following permissions. Required permissions \u00b6 Read Messages \u00b6 This permission is needed for obvious reasons. If the bot can't read messages, it can't respond to commands. If this permission is not set for a channel, the bot won't even appear on the online list on that channel. This permission can be denied for specific channel if you don't want it to be on that channel. If this permission is denied, all other permissions are considered denied automatically. Send Messages \u00b6 An obligatory permission. The bot needs this to be able to respond to commands and make announcements. Add Reactions \u00b6 This permission is needed in order for command pagination to work. Read Message History \u00b6 Due to a Discord API limitation, the bot must be able to read message history in order to be able to know when a message has been reacted to in paginating commands. Manage Messages \u00b6 This permission lets the bot delete other people messages and reactions. This is used for the ask channel so the bot can remove messages that are not commands. This is also needed for command pagination so the bot can remove the user's reaction so they can react again easily. Embed Links \u00b6 Many commands feature Discord embeds. These are rich format replies that allow the use of masked links, thumbnails, time stamps, fields, etcetera. Denying this permission makes such commands stop working. Use External Emojis \u00b6 This permission is needed for NabBot to be able to display its custom emojis. Recommended permissions \u00b6 Attach Files \u00b6 This permission allows the bot to attach files as part of the message. Some commands like /item , /monster and /house display a related image. Disabling this permission won't break those commands functionality but images won't be shown anymore. View Audit Log \u00b6 It lets the bot check the audit log for more information when a member leaves, is banned or changes nickname. With this, the bot is able to tell if a member was kicked or left the server on his own, or if they updated their nickname or someone edited it for them. This is only relevant for servers that have a #server-log channel. Manage Channels \u00b6 This permission is only needed if you're using the watched-list feature.

Commands can be used on any channel where the bot can read and write. Some commands may require extra permissions such as Embed Links or Attach Files , or might not be allowed in private messages. Some commands can show longer responses if used in ask-channel (by default, #ask-nabbot). For descriptions of each command check the different commands sections in the sidebar. In discord, you can use the command help to see a list of commands. Only commands that you are allowed to use will be shown. Paginator \u00b6 Some commands responses feature a paginator ( based on RoboDany's paginator class ). These can be easily spotted by the reactions automatically added to the reply (\u25c0\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f\u23f9\ufe0f). These reactions act as buttons, letting you scroll through the results.

Optional parameters are enclosed in brackets [] . claim \u00b6 Syntax: claim <name> Claims a character as yours, even if it is already registered to someone else. In order for this to work, you have to put a special code in the character's comment. You can see this code by using the command with no parameters. The code looks like this: /NB-23FC13AC7400000/ Once you had set the code, you can use the command with that character, if the code matches, it will be reassigned to you. Note that it may take some time for the code to be visible to NabBot because of caching. This code is unique for your discord user, so the code will only work for your discord account and no one else. No one can claim a character of yours unless you put their code on your character's comment. im \u00b6 Syntax: im <characterName> Other aliases: i'm , iam Lets you add your tibia character(s) for the bot to track. The bot scans the character and other characters on the account and registers them to the user. Registered characters have their deaths and level ups announced on the chat. The bot will skip characters on different worlds than the world the discord server tracks. Also, if it finds a character owned by another user, the whole process will be stopped. If a character is already registered to someone else, /claim can be used. Example /im Elf imnot \u00b6 Syntax: imnot <characterName> Other aliases: i'mnot Removes a character assigned to you All registered level ups and deaths will be lost forever. Example /imnot tomas haake online \u00b6 Tells you which users are online on Tibia. This list gets updated based on Tibia.com online list, so it takes a couple minutes to be updated.

To see the related commands check the Roles commands . These features require the bot to have Manage Roles permission, as this is required to be able to add and remove roles. Only users with Manage Roles permissions can edit and check rules, and they can't edit any rules for roles higher than theirs. Adding rules \u00b6 Automatic roles work based on rules. A rule consist of a role and a guild. When a user has a registered character in a guild contained in a rule, the role is added. If that character leaves the guild or the user unregisters the character, their role will be removed, unless they met another rule for that role. Rules can be added by using autorole add . The command takes two parameters: A role and a guild. Examples /autorole add @Redd Alliance Redd Alliance \u2013 Members of Redd Alliance will receive the role @Redd Alliance . Note that @Redd Alliance must be mentionable to be added this way, and it will ping all role members. /autorole add 162767187474513920 Redd Retreat \u2013 Members of Redd Retreat will receive the role with id 162767187474513920 . Role ids can be obtained by using roleinfo . /autorole add \"Bald Dwarfs\" Bald Dwarfs \u2013 Members of Bald Dwarfs will receive the role @Bald Dwarfs . Note that since the role name contains multiple words, it must be quoted. Guilds never need to be quoted. /autorole add Identified * \u2013 Any user that has registered character will be given the @Identified role. You can have as many rules as you want, for as many roles or guilds as needed, as long as they're not repeated. It is also possible to have multiple rules for the same roles. In practice, this can be used to have a @Allies role. All the allied guilds would be added to the same role. The list of rules can be checked using autorole list . Example rule list Applying rules \u00b6 Once the rules have been set, NabBot will start enforcing them whenever certain triggers are actioned: A new member joins the server, with previously registered characters. A member uses /im to register characters. A member uses /imnot to unregister characters. A registered character is checked using /whois and a guild change is detected. A registered character is checked while online in the level and deaths tracking process. Limitations \u00b6 If a rule is removed, there's currently no way to \"undo\" that rule, e.g. if the rule for @Guildies is removed, NabBot won't remove the role from any users, unless there's another rule involving that rule that they don't meet. Unless checked using /whois , there is no way to apply rules to characters that haven't been online in a while. Meaning that an old inactive member that was kicked from a guild, won't have their role removed until they log in or they are check with /whois . If an automatic role is assigned/removed manually by someone, the bot might remove/reassign it again when the character is checked. Newly added rules are not applied for existing members until a character change is detected. Using autorole refresh will check all members again.

This file is generated on the first startup, based on the template found in data/config_template.yml . On every startup, the config file is checked and it notifies via console if any key is missing or there's a key not supported. If a key is missing, a default value is taken, so the bot is still able to function without trouble. If there's an extra key found, this can mean that a previous configuration entry was removed or a typo was made. The correct structure can always be found in config_template.yml . Channels \u00b6 ask_channel_name : ask-nabbot ask_channel_delete : true log_channel_name : server-log Specifies the names of NabBot's special channels. The ask channel is a special channel where NabBot will give longer replies. This is used to reduce spam in main channels by keeping responses short. The ask_channel_delete key specifies if messages that are not commands in the ask channel should be deleted or not. This way you can keep #ask-nabbot as a commands only channel. The log channel is a special channel where NabBot posts server events such as members joining, leaving or getting banned. The bot will announce the following events here: A new member joined, with a list of their previously registered characters, if available A member left or was kicked (if the bot has View Audit Log permission, it can tell the difference) A member was banned A member changed his name or nick. A member registered or unregistered characters. The server's name was changed The server's region was changed. Command prefix \u00b6 command_prefix : - \"/\" command_mention : false The prefix for commands that the bot will use. By default, the bot will listen to commands like: /about , /help . The prefix / can be changed, or even more prefixes can be added like: command_prefix : - \"/\" - \"$\" So the bot would now also answer to $about and $help . Note that the bot will always answering by being mentioned, e.g. @NabBot help , @NabBot about . It's recommended to keep this list as short as possible, and to make sure it does not overlap with the command prefix of other bots. This setting can be overriden on a per-server basis by using the command settings Extra cogs \u00b6 For more information, see Cogs # Add extra features by adding your own cogs. extra_cogs : [] Welcome PM \u00b6 When a member joins a server, he is greeted via private message with a message. This can be customized: # The welcome message that is sent to members when they join a discord server with NabBot in it # The following keyboards can be used: # {user.name} - The joining user's name # {user.mention} - The joining user's mention # {server.name} - The name of the server the member joined. # {owner.name} - The name of the owner of the server. # {owner.mention} - A mention to the owner of the server. # {bot.name} - The name of the bot # {bot.mention} - The name of the bot welcome_pm : | Welcome to **{server.name}**! I'm **{bot.name}**, to learn more about my commands type `/help` Start by telling me who is your Tibia character, say **/im *character_name*** so I can begin tracking your level ups and deaths! The string can have special formatting that is replaced at runtime, for example, {server.name} would be replaced by NabBot Support if the member joined that server. The | character in the first line lets the string be multiline. If two line jumps are added together, it will turn into a single line jump. A custom message can be appended to this for a specific server by using /setwelcome . Note This is not reliable anymore since Discord introduced privacy features that allow users to disable private messages from members of servers they join. Owner IDs \u00b6 owner_ids : - 162060569803751424 - 162070610556616705 This gives the users with those user ids permission to use any commands and by pass most regulations. The owner of the bot's application is always considered even if their id is not here. This allows them to use sensitive commands like /shutdown and /restart or execute Python code directly. Timezones \u00b6 display_brasilia_time : true display_sonora_time : true Specifies how many concurrent loot scanning jobs can be active. Announce Threshold \u00b6 announce_threshold : 30 This is the mininum level for NabBot to announce levels and deaths. Note that even if they are not announced, they are still tracked and stored. Checking a character directly using /deaths or /levels will show all entries, but seeing them in overall lists using the commands without parameters will hide such entries. Online List Expiration \u00b6 online_list_expiration : 300 In order to prevent losing level up announcements because NabBot was restarted, the state of online players is saved in a file. However, if the data is too old, it must be discarded to prevent errors. This is in the interval in seconds to consider the online list still valid. Scan intervals \u00b6 # Delay inbreed server checks online_scan_interval : 40 # Delay in between player death checks in seconds death_scan_interval : 15 # Delay between each tracked world's highscore check and delay between pages scan highscores_delay : 45 highscores_page_delay : 10 # Delay between retries when there's a network error in seconds network_retry_delay : 1 These are intervals related to fetching operations. These were relevant when Tibia.com was used for most of the data, to reduce errors due to CipSoft blocking constant requests. Now that TibiaData is used, this is not as relevant, as they use caching. This might be removed in future updates. Emojis \u00b6 Some information is displayed using emojis, to make it easier to identify at quick glance. These emojis can be personalized by editing the configuration file. Apart of unicode (standard) emojis, custom discord emojis can be used. Discord bots are able to use emojis from any server they are in, anywhere, like they had Nitro . It is recommended to use custom emojis from a server where no one else can modify them, as this may break NabBot. A server dedicated for emojis may be created, inviting the bot for it to use them. To use a custom emoji, you have to declare it like: <:name:id> , for example: <:fireDamage:458794525050142740> . For animated emojis, you have to add a , example: <a:paladin:45233654759231> . To find out the id of an emoji, there's two ways to do it: Right click and emoji, select Copy Link , a link like https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/458794525050142740.png?v=1 will be created. The numeric part is the emoji's id. Send a message with the emoji, placing \\ before, e.g. \\:fireDamage: . The resulting message will contain the escaped emoji: <:fireDamage:458794525050142740> . Alternatively, if you have the server-log enabled, you can see the id of an emoji when it's created or modified. The following are values that always require to have an emoji assigned. These will always default to a unicode emoji. # Required emojis # These values must always have an emoji to display online_emoji : \ud83d\udd39 true_emoji : \u2705 false_emoji : \u274c levelup_emoji : \ud83c\udf1f death_emoji : \u2620 pvpdeath_emoji : \ud83d\udc80 # These emojis are also used in vocation filtering novoc_emoji : \ud83d\udc23 druid_emoji : \u2744 sorcerer_emoji : \ud83d\udd25 paladin_emoji : \ud83c\udff9 knight_emoji : \ud83d\udee1 # Emojis for bestiary info charms_emoji : \u269c difficulty_on_emoji : \u2b50 difficulty_off_emoji : \u25aa occurrence_on_emoji : \ud83d\udd39 occurrence_off_emoji : \u25aa The following are optional emojis.

If a key is missing, a default value is taken, so the bot is still able to function without trouble.

The ask_channel_delete key specifies if messages that are not commands in the ask channel should be deleted or not. This way you can keep #ask-nabbot as a commands only channel. The log channel is a special channel where NabBot posts server events such as members joining, leaving or getting banned. The bot will announce the following events here: A new member joined, with a list of their previously registered characters, if available A member left or was kicked (if the bot has View Audit Log permission, it can tell the difference) A member was banned A member changed his name or nick.

These emojis can be personalized by editing the configuration file. Apart of unicode (standard) emojis, custom discord emojis can be used. Discord bots are able to use emojis from any server they are in, anywhere, like they had Nitro . It is recommended to use custom emojis from a server where no one else can modify them, as this may break NabBot. A server dedicated for emojis may be created, inviting the bot for it to use them. To use a custom emoji, you have to declare it like: <:name:id> , for example: <:fireDamage:458794525050142740> . For animated emojis, you have to add a , example: <a:paladin:45233654759231> . To find out the id of an emoji, there's two ways to do it: Right click and emoji, select Copy Link , a link like https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/458794525050142740.png?v=1 will be created. The numeric part is the emoji's id. Send a message with the emoji, placing \\ before, e.g. \\:fireDamage: . The resulting message will contain the escaped emoji: <:fireDamage:458794525050142740> . Alternatively, if you have the server-log enabled, you can see the id of an emoji when it's created or modified. The following are values that always require to have an emoji assigned.
