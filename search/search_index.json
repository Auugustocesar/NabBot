Number scan updated to properly handle stacks higher than three digits (mostly to be able to scan images taken from the stash, also recognizes the letter K in stack numbers)  Now properly scans slots even if a few pixels at the bottom were cut off or blocked by the window border.  Massive performance improvements.    Minimum announce level is now configurable per server ( /settings minlevel ).  Event channel is now disabled by default.  New configurable emoji:  loading_emoji  By default \u23f3 is used.    Removed restart scripts as they were outdated, very platform specific and bad practice.  Improved world scanning speed to not be heavily affected by the number of tracked worlds.  New  /sql  command, executes a sql query and shows the results, only for the bot owner.  New  /wikistats  command, shows you information about the TibiaWiki database used.  /removechar  now only lets you remove chars from users that are only in servers you are an admin in.  Fixed bug in  /event make  showing failure icon on success.  Fixed bug in  /addchar , it was not working at all.  Fixed bug in  /world  when query included spaces.  Fixed bug in  /monster  failing if it was missing some bestiary data.  Fixed bug in  /event addplayer  failing when the character was not registered.  Fixed error when using  /share  with no parameters.  Fixed bug in commands that offer you choices not working in commands channel.  Fixed bug in  /choose  when the command was used with no parameters.  /stamina  now considers the 10 minutes you have to be logged off to start regenerating stamina.  Removed  /restart  command as it was really system specific and not an universal solution, along with the autorestarting launchers.  Command error now contains a link to the support server.",
