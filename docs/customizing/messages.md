One of NabBot's main features is the ability to announce when registered characters level up and ~~make fun~~ announce deaths.

These messages can be found on `utils/messages.py`, in the variables `level_messages`, `death_messages_monster` and `death_messages_player`.

Each list item is made of another list representing each message. The first element, is a number representing the message's weight, or chances to appear.
The second element is the message itself, with some formatting placeholders that are dynamically replaced.
The rest of the elements are conditions that are explained on the following sections.

The chances of each message being selected is based on the first element of the message item, the higher it is, the more likely it is to be selected.


## Level up messages
Level messages have the following parameters that are dynamically replaced, these are enclosed in `{}`:

* name - The name of the character that leveled.
* level - The level the character obtained.
* he_she, his_her, him_her - Pronouns selected based on the character's gender.

Each item of this list is a list with the following items:
