!!! note
    In order to run and manage NabBot, basic knowledge of Python is expected.

## Can you help me or make a cavebot/macro?
**No.**

## I can't run NabBot, python is not found.
If you get an error like this: `“python” is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`, it can be due to one of these reasons:
* Python is not installed. To install visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
* The python folder is not in the `PATH` enviroment variable. This is prompted when installing Python.

## \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ doesn't look well or doesn't work on mobile
The Android and iOS versions of Discord are really behind the web or standalone client, so NabBot is focused on desktop users. If we limit ourselves to the mobile versions we would be slowing down the development of NabBot

## How can I make NabBot work for this OT server?
NabBot was made to work specifically for Tibia, it depends completely on the layout of Tibia.com so even if the URLs were changed to an OT's website, the code used to parse information would have to be changed.

However, if you're an OT owner, an API could be easily developed to let NabBot extract information more efficiently and even show a lot of extra information that is not available in Tibia.com
