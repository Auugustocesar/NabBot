## /unload

Unloads a cog. Cogs are extensions that contain their own commands and tasks.

!!! Note
    Unloading `cogs.owner` would remove the `/load` command, making it impossible to reload cogs until restarting the bot.

    **/unload cogs.tibia**

## /load

Loads a cog. If there's an error while compiling, it will be displayed here.
Any cog can be loaded here, including cogs made by user.

When loading and unloading cogs in subdirectories, periods (`.`) are used instead of slashes (`/`).
For example, a cog found in `cogs/tibia.py` would be loaded as `cogs.tibia`.
